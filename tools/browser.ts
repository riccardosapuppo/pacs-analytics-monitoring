/**
 * Which browser the checks drive, and why it is not always the same one.
 *
 * On a desk the answer is Edge, already installed. `playwright-core` drives a
 * browser that is there rather than fetching one, and that is deliberate: the
 * README promises Node and nothing else, and `npm install` pulling down 300 MB
 * of browser would make that promise false for everybody who only wants to run
 * the console. These are checks, not a dependency.
 *
 * In continuous integration there is no Edge and nothing to protect: the runner
 * installs a browser, runs them, and is thrown away. The one it installs is the
 * Chromium Playwright brings with it.
 *
 * So the channel is a setting with a sensible default rather than a constant.
 * Until it was, `check:screen` was named in the README as one of the checks and
 * could not have run on a Linux runner at all -- so it ran on one machine, on
 * the days somebody remembered, which is the same as not having it.
 *
 * Empty and unset are deliberately different. Unset means "the local default";
 * empty means "whatever Playwright brought", which is not a channel at all and
 * has to reach `launch` as undefined rather than as an empty string -- asking
 * for a channel named nothing fails with a message about a missing browser,
 * which reads like the machine has none.
